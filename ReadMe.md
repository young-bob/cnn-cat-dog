# Project Objectives

1. **Hands-on Deep Learning Experience**: Gain practical experience in deep learning by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using the TensorFlow-Keras API. This approach emphasizes hands-on learning in model development and deployment.

2. **Image Classification Techniques**: Explore how convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers work together to perform effective feature extraction and image classification.

3. **Model Performance Assessment**: Evaluate the trained model on a dedicated test dataset to assess its accuracy and reliability. Use the model to predict the class of unseen images and analyze its real-world applicability.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on building a CNN to classify images of cats and dogs. The training dataset comprises 4,000 images of dogs and 4,000 images of cats, while the evaluation is conducted on a test set of 1,000 images per class. After training, the model will be applied to classify images in the `single_prediction` folder, determining whether each image depicts a cat or a dog.

# Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Use TensorFlow with its integrated Keras API for model construction. Keras, originally a standalone high-level API for neural networks, is now a core component of TensorFlow, providing a simplified and user-friendly interface. Its integration with TensorFlow ensures access to a robust backend, optimized computation, and distributed training capabilities.

- **Advantages of Keras within TensorFlow**:
  - Streamlined design of complex deep learning models.
  - Accessibility for both beginners and advanced users.
  - Native support for TensorFlow features, such as model serialization.

By leveraging these tools, this project combines accessibility and computational efficiency, equipping developers with the skills to design, train, and deploy deep learning models effectively.
